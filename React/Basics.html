React is a just javascript code..
index file->first to get executed whenever the page get loaded
before moving the code to the browser , this will take the code and do some extra things like
importing the code and executed
index.js is the first file to be executed
ReactDom and react are both part of react-library
ReactDOM helps in identifying where the root file should be executed in the browser..
so it locate the root div in index.html file and execute our code there..
ReactDOM.createRoot basically tells that div with id root will be the root of the application..
now after that we can call the render method root.render(
<App />) to tell what will be rendered in the root
content of the div should be replaced with that
<App /> content
./=>please look in the same folder as where it is called

JSX
html code inside javascript... jsx is javascript XML because HTML is XML
JSX will be converted into basic js syntax

How React works
react allow you to create re-usable adn reactive components consisting of HTML and JS(and Css)
declarative approach is define the desired target states and let react figure out the actual JS DOM instructions
JS is doing imperative approach where you give clear instructions to what do
You define the desired outcome (eg a target UI) and let the library (react) figures out steps
const para=document.createElement('p');
para.textContent='this is a paragraph'
document.getElementBYId('root').append(para);

but in react all you have to define a state and react will take the course in its own hands like in app.js file
return (
<p> this is a paragraph</p>
)
App.js is a root component of all other file and we kind of making a component tree
<App /> rendered into a single HTML page
|
<Header />

A component in react is just a special javascript function that return JSX codeI
Important=>You must have a single element per return JSX code
{} in curly expression, you can create a regular java script expression

for a shell ,
first to render a component inside a component you have to use props.children and for classes use class you wanna
apply +props.className which is default class which has been applied


const Card = (props) => {
const classes = "card " + props.className;
return <div className={classes}>{props.children}</div>;
};

basically under the hood react convert the jsx code like this......
return React.createElement(
"div",
{},
React.createElement("h2", {}, "let's get started"),
React.createElement(ExpenseInitial, { expenses: expenses })
);

and thats why we have one wrapper....
