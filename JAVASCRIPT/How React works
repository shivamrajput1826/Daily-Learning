1)React determine how the component tree currently look like and what it should look like..
ReactDom receives the differences (i.e required changes)  and then manipulate the real DOM.
Re-evaluating the components is not re-rendering the dom


** React re-evalute whenever the ####props,state or context### changes.React execute the component functions and then changes in the real dom would be only the evaluated differences between the 
two doms.

whenever a state in a particular component change, the whole component re-render again..
whenever a component get re-executed, all its child component get re-evaluated again..
