A single microservice contains all the routing,middlewares,business logic ,database access to implement one 
feature of an app so that if all other features crashes,this feature remains there.
==>> every service has its own database
==>> Services will never,ever reach into another service database

Why database per service
1) We want each service to run independently of other services
2) Database schema/structure might change unexpectedly.
3) Some services might function more efficiently with different types of DB's (sql vs nosql)
