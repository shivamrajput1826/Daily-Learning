An Api gateway is an API management tool that sits between a client
and a collection of backend services.

An api gateway act as a reverse proxy to accept all application 
programming interface(API) calls,aggregate the various required
services to fulfill them, and return the appropriate result.

You want to protect your APIs from overuse and abuse, so you use an authentication service and rate limiting. 

You want to understand how people use your APIs, so you’ve added analytics and monitoring tools.

If you have monetized APIs, you’ll want to connect to a billing system.

You may have adopted a microservices architecture, in which case a single request could require 
calls to dozens of distinct applications.

Over time you’ll add some new API services and retire others, but your clients will still want to 
find all your services in the same place.

When you have a lot of microservices in a single application, an API gateway provides you the platform for rendering 
all the apis through a single centre..
