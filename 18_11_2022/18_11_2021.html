Form Creator
Container->subcontainer->wrapper

in schema
1)Component->which component to show which basically mapped to component mapped
2)id is basically the form data is bind to the specified ids
3)is hidden->whether to hide or not , sometimes its dependent on the parent component so its value will be 
shown according to it

4)        displayKey get a clarification on it


5)props->whatever we want to pass on to that component
6)we can add sublabel in the props,
7)tip is the extra information that we want to give it to user regarding the component
8)User children you get containers or subcontainers information

9)What is event map in component map


10)Schema is prepared by us and we sent the schema to the backend. After that backend renders the schema and 
after that they do the changes in the constant.ts
Basically if a new schema is there, we need to make sure there is a desirable vue component which can render my 
schema and then we can make changes in the constant.ts
You have to provide the id for it as well
11)Slot is basically used for rendering the things which are not present in the schema
  The space where slot should be there will be present by schema but what should be presented on the slot would be 
  decided by the component which use the form creator
  Lets say I am in health repo, renders a form and then what to show something on the form which is not in the schema then we can use slot for this purpose
  ID which is provided in the schema for slot such as "CustomSlotUniqueID" should be same as the id which you will provide in the health repo 
  Position is also important
In the health repo inside opening and closing form index,
<form-index>
<template #CustomSlotUniqueID>
write your slot data
</template>
</form-index>


12)Use of custom slot ->basically we get a array of ids and then it get passed to form-component


13)Signal=>Basically certain hooks which we use to implement when a particular event is triggered through form rendering. These events will be used in the projects when a certain form is rendered.

14)Backend pe aane se phle pre-processing and then post processing


VUE_COMPONENT
FE-commons ,vue-components and vue-form creator worked on rollup (a module bundler) 
main reason due to different types of builds
So it will prioritize and then some thing called as esm build, here some treeshaking is possible which we need to know... so lets say in rollup we can ask for specific functionality such as monitoring so we dont have to worry about all the builds coming together... only that particular bundle will be imported

Learn regarding webpack and are they providing esm build????
<treeShaking????>
